# Introduction to the labs

The lab sessions of System-on-Chip design and experimentation will result in cool and unique, but very expensive, Christmas lights. Each student (or pair of students, depending on the number of enrollments) has to build his/her lights. By the end of the semester, in the final lab session, we will string up all the designs and have Christmas decoration. It maybe not be the time of the year for Christmas decoration when the project is finished, but blinky and RGB lights are always fun.

Every **light** in the chain will be built using a {{% pynq %}} board.

A master will control the complete system and the final setup is depicted below. Every single connection operates with an **extremely simplified I2C** protocol.

## Evaluation

#### Assignments

During the lessons exercises will be made and I will ask you to hand in some exercises on toledo.

#### Final project

The final project has a **demonstration** during the last lesson. You will come to the classroom and have to program a FPGA and we will verify if does everything according the specification.
